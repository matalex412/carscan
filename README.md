# Car Catcher
A React Native mobile app which allows users to take pictures of cars, to create a virtual car collection. 
The make of the car can be detected from the number plate using an API.
Pictures of cars are rewarded with coins depending on rarity of the care make. Earned coins could then be used to purchase cars from the store.
